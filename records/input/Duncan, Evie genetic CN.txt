Subjective
is a 44yoF with HFrEF, dilated cardiomyopathy, frequent PVCs and atrial tachycardia s/p ablation.
Medical History: No significant childhood illnesses, developmental delays, or learning difficulties.
developed postpartum cardiomyopathy after her fourth pregnancy in 2015. Initial echo showed severe LV dilation, moderately reduced LV systolic function with global hypokinesis, moderate LA dilation, and moderate mitral regurgitation. Stress test showed no ischemia. She has been on medical therapy since then. Earlier this year was noted to have frequent PVCs with monitor showing 18% PVC burden. She underwent atrial tachycardia ablation, PVC ablation, and ICD implantation earlier this month.
She presented to the ED late last week with chest pain and shortness of breath. Echo showed EF of 11% down from 28% on echo prior to ablation. In addition to the reduced ejection fraction, echo this admission showing severely reduced ventricular systolic function, severely enlarged LV, global LV hypokinesis, mild LA dilation, moderate to severe mitral valve regurgitation, reduced RV systolic function, dilated IVC, and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
denies any other significant medical diagnoses or chronic problems.
Family History: One child with asthma One child with asthma and gestational diabetes One child with sickle cell disease (HbSC) One child is healthy None of her children have ever had echocardiograms. 7 siblings all of whom are relatively healthy Mom is deceased. She was diagnosed with congestive heart failure around age 50y. Dad is healthy

Assessment/Plan Acute decompensated heart failure I50.9 Chest pain R07.9 Dyspnea R06.00 Peripartum cardiomyopathy O90.3 PVC's (premature ventricular contractions) I49.3 is a 44yoF with HFrEF, dilated cardiomyopathy, frequent PVCs and atrial tachycardia s/p ablation.
There are many known genes in which pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants increase an individuals likeliness to develop hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. While pregnancy is a known cause of heart failure, it is relatively rare, and genetic changes can also underlie cardiomyopathies that initially present in the peripartum period. Given 's age at diagnosis, progression despite maximal medical therapy, and the family history in her mother all raise my suspicion of an underlying genetic predisposition. Therefore, recommend comprehensive genetic testing at this time.
We discussed that while genetic testing is very helpful, a negative result does not rule out an underlying genetic predisposition to cardiomyopathy as we do not understand what all of the human genes do. Therefore, given family history, 's children are at an increased risk of cardiomyopathy regardless of genetic testing results. Therefore, recommend screening echocardiograms for all children. This can be arranged through their pediatrician.
Recommendations:
1) Will proceed with whole genome sequencing. See GC note for consent documentation.
2) Recommend screening echocardiograms for all of 's children.
3) Follow up in CV genetics clinic per protocol.

This case was discussed with the resident and I agree with the history, physical exam, and medical decision making as documented. I spent a total of 60 minutes with patient and family and >50% of that was spent in counseling and coordination of care as well as time spent on the date of visit on extensive records review, documentation, order entry and communication.
