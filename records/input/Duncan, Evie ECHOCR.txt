2. Left ventricular chamber dimension is severely enlarged.
3. Global left ventricular hypokinesis.
4. Mild left atrial dilatation.
5. There is moderate to severe mitral valve regurgitation.
6. Right ventricular systolic function is reduced.
7. There is no pericardia! effusion.
8. Dilated inferior vena cava with <50% collapse upon inspiration.
9. Right ventricular systolic pressure is 56 mmHg, consistent with moderate pulmonary hypertension.
